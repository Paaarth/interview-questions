Primitive types: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `bigint`, `symbol`. Reference type: `object` (includes arrays and functions)[^2][^3][^7].

### 3. What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?

**Answer:**
`undefined` means a variable has been declared but not assigned a value. `null` is an assignment value representing no value or an empty value[^3]

### 4. What is hoisting in JavaScript?

**Answer:**
Hoisting is JavaScript’s default behavior of moving declarations to the top of their scope before code execution[^2][^3][^5].

**Answer:**
`var` is function-scoped, `let` and `const` are block-scoped. `let` can be reassigned, `const` cannot be reassigned[^3]

### 6. What is the difference between `==` and `===`?

**Answer:**
`==` checks for value equality after type coercion; `===` checks for value and type equality without coercion[^3]

### 7. What is a closure?

**Answer:**
A closure is a function that has access to its own scope, the outer function’s variables, and global variables[^3]

### 8. What is an anonymous function?

**Answer:**
An anonymous function is a function without a name, often used as arguments to other functions

### 9. What is a callback function?

**Answer:**
A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function and executed after some event or task[^3]

**Answer:**
Prototypal inheritance is a feature where objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects[^3]

### 31. What is the difference between `Object.create()` and constructor functions?

**Answer:**

#### Q1: What is the difference between Angular's `ngOnInit` and constructor? ⭐⭐

**Answer:**

- The **constructor** is a default method in TypeScript classes that gets called when a class is instantiated.
- **ngOnInit** is an Angular lifecycle hook that runs after Angular has finished initializing all data-bound properties.
- Key difference: Use constructor for basic initialization and dependency injection, use ngOnInit for component-specific initialization logic.

#### Q2: Explain the difference between Angular's `ngIf` and `hidden` property ⭐⭐

**Answer:**

- **ngIf** is a structural directive that completely removes/adds elements from the DOM based on the condition.
- **hidden** is a DOM property that simply toggles visibility using CSS (display: none).
- Key difference: ngIf is better for memory efficiency as it destroys unused components, while hidden maintains them in memory.

## [[⬆]](#toc) <a name=NodejsBackend>Node.js Backend</a>

#### Q1: What is the Event Loop in Node.js? ⭐⭐

**Answer:**

- The **Event Loop** is what allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations.
- It's a single-threaded loop that processes events and callbacks in different phases (timers, I/O callbacks, idle/prepare, poll, check, close callbacks).
- Key point: It enables Node's asynchronous nature despite JavaScript being single-threaded.

#### Q1: What is Git fork? What is difference between fork, branch and clone? ⭐⭐

**Answer:**

- A **fork** is a remote, server-side copy of a repository, distinct from the original. A fork isn't a Git concept really, it's more a political/social idea.
- A **clone** is not a fork; a clone is a local copy of some remote repository. When you clone, you are actually copying the entire source repository, including all the history and branches.
- A **branch** is a mechanism to handle the changes within a single repository in order to eventually merge them with the rest of code. A branch is something that is within a repository. Conceptually, it represents a thread of development.
